<div id="h2-1"><h2> Jason and Judy in the USA</h2></div>
<p>
    Last year Jason was in England. This autumn - or this fall, as Jason would
    say -Judy is staying with Jason's family in Boston in the United States.
    Jason: So, how does it feel to be in the United States?
    Judy: Pretty good, actually. But you drive on the wrong side of the road.
    Jason: Yeah, I noticed that in England too! Any trouble with the language?
    Judy: No problem. I understand almost everything people say.
    Jason: Great! You'll soon be speaking perfect American.
    Judy: No way!
    Jason: There you are! Perfect American already.
